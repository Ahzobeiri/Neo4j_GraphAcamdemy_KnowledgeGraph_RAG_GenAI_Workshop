# Neo4j_GraphAcamdemy_KnowledgeGraph_RAG_GenAI_Workshop
Thanks to Neo4j GrpahAcademy for providing this valuable GenAI workshop in applying knowledge graph RAG for constructing LLM-generated content based on Neo4j, Python, and LangChain.ðŸ¦¾ðŸ§  

After completing this workshop, I encountered small challenges in coding and made several changes and improvements, such as adding my data instead of the workshop data, working with AzureOpenAI and Llama 3 from Grok instead of GPT-4, etc. These experiences led me to create this repository and share my personal experiences from this valuable workshop. This whole repo is completely dedicated to the [Neo4j and Graph Academy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/). 

This workshop was divided into two main parts: The first part, "Knowledge Graphs, Unstructured Data, and Vectors" ended with the creation of knowledge graphs on the Neo4j platform, while the second part, "LLMs, RAG, Python, and LangChain" involved using the RAG technique along with LangChain and Python to build an LLM-based agent. A [Github repository](https://github.com/neo4j-graphacademy/genai-workshop) containing the starter code and whole resources was also provided for this workshop.
