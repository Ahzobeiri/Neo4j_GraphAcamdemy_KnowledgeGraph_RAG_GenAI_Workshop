# Neo4j_GraphAcamdemy_KnowledgeGraph_RAG_GenAI_Workshop
Thanks to Neo4j GrpahAcademy for providing this valuable GenAI workshop in applying knowledge graph RAG in grounding LLM-generated content using Neo4j, Python, and LangChain.ðŸ¦¾ðŸ§  

After completing this workshop, I encountered small challenges in coding and made several changes and improvements, such as adding my data instead of the workshop data, working with AzureOpenAI and Llama 3 from Grok instead of GPT-4, etc. These experiences led me to create this repository and share my personal experiences from this valuable workshop. This whole repo is completely dedicated to the [Neo4j and Graph Academy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/).
